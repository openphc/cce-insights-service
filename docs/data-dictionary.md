# CCE Insights Service — Data Dictionary

Comprehensive reference for all database tables queried, DTOs, query parameters, aggregation formulas, and metrics used by the Insights Service.

> The Insights Service does **not own** any database tables. All tables are owned by the Protocol Service, Matcher Service and Step SLA Service (the 1.x Compliance Service was split into these three in 2.0.0), the Intelligence Service, or the Collector Service. The service reads their ClickHouse copies in `cce_analytics` (Debezium CDC from PostgreSQL `ccedb`; DDL in `cce-data-pipeline/schema`), where table names are plural (`step_instances`, `deviations`, `matcher_event_logs`, …). This data dictionary documents the read-only view used by the Insights Service.

## 1. Database Tables (Read-Only)

### 1.1 `protocol_definition`

Protocol definition metadata. Queried for display names and protocol versioning.

| Column | Type | Used By Insights | Purpose |
|--------|------|------------------|----------|
| `id` | `UUID` | Yes | PK — join target for protocol-level APIs |
| `url` | `VARCHAR` | Yes | Protocol canonical URL |
| `version` | `VARCHAR` | Yes | Protocol version |
| `status` | `VARCHAR` | Yes | Filter active vs retired protocols |
| `definition` | `JSONB` | Yes | Full FHIR R4 PlanDefinition — protocol name from `definition->'name'`, title from `definition->'title'`, action order from `definition->'action'` array (type from `action.type.coding[0].code`, title from `action.title`), `relatedArtifact` array with documentation URLs and thumbnail image references |
| `loaded_at` | `TIMESTAMPTZ` | Yes | When protocol was loaded |

### 1.2 `protocol_instance`

Patient enrollments in protocols. Primary table for compliance aggregation.

| Column | Type | Used By Insights | Purpose |
|--------|------|------------------|---------|
| `id` | `UUID` | Yes | PK |
| `protocol_definition_id` | `UUID` | Yes | FK → `protocol_definition.id` |
| `patient_id` | `VARCHAR` | Yes | Patient UPID — group-by key |
| `status` | `VARCHAR` | Yes | `ACTIVE`, `COMPLETED`, `WITHDRAWN`, `EXPIRED` |
| `enrolled_at` | `TIMESTAMPTZ` | Yes | Enrollment timestamp |
| `created_at` | `TIMESTAMPTZ` | Yes | Record creation |
| `updated_at` | `TIMESTAMPTZ` | Yes | Last status change |

> **2.0.0:** `protocol_canonical` was dropped. The API's `protocolCanonical` (`url|version`) is rebuilt by joining `protocol_definitions` on `protocol_definition_id` (`AbstractClickHouseRepository.protocolInstancesWithCanonical`).

> **Note:** `protocol_instance` does not have a `facility_id` column. Facility-based filtering is achieved by joining through `event_log.facility_id` (using `event_log.protocol_instance_id`).

### 1.3 `step_instance`

Individual protocol steps per patient. Primary table for compliance calculations.
2.0.0 split the 1.x `state` column into two independent statuses written by two services:
`step_status` (Matcher — did the expected event arrive?) and `sla_status` (Step SLA — was the deadline met?).

| Column | Type | Used By Insights | Purpose |
|--------|------|------------------|---------|
| `id` | `UUID` | Yes | PK |
| `protocol_instance_id` | `UUID` | Yes | FK → `protocol_instance.id` |
| `action_id` | `VARCHAR` | Yes | PlanDefinition action ID |
| `repeat_index` | `INTEGER` | Yes | Recurrence index |
| `step_status` | `VARCHAR` | Yes | `NOT_STARTED`, `COMPLETED` |
| `sla_status` | `VARCHAR` | Yes | `OVERDUE`, `MISSED`, `MET`; NULL in PostgreSQL = not yet judged, which lands in ClickHouse as `''` (also the permanent value for optional steps) |
| `due_date` | `TIMESTAMPTZ` | Yes | When step becomes due |
| `completed_at` | `TIMESTAMPTZ` | Yes | Completion timestamp (clinical time of the completing event) |
| `completed_by_source` | `VARCHAR` | Yes | Source system that completed |
| `matched_event_id` | `UUID` | Yes | FK → `matcher_event_log.id` (1.x `completed_by_event_id`) |
| `required_behavior` | `VARCHAR` | Yes | FHIR `requiredBehavior`: `must`, `could`, `must-unless-documented` |

> **Removed in 2.0.0:** `state`, `completion_status`, `overdue_date`, `missed_date`. The overdue / missed
> thresholds now live in `step_sla_state_transition` (§1.3a). `MET` is only reached by a completion that
> beat the due date, so `OVERDUE` / `MISSED` can sit on a completed (late) step as well as an outstanding one.

### 1.3a `step_sla_state_transition` (new in 2.0.0)

Each mandatory step's SLA schedule — one row per verdict the Step SLA Service is to reach (Matcher
inserts, Step SLA marks processed).

| Column | Type | Used By Insights | Purpose |
|--------|------|------------------|---------|
| `id` | `UUID` | No | PK |
| `step_instance_id` | `UUID` | Yes | FK → `step_instance.id` |
| `transition_type` | `VARCHAR` | Yes | `DUE_DATE_REACHED` (→ OVERDUE on a breach), `MISSED_DATE_REACHED` (→ MISSED), `MET_CONDITION_REACHED` (→ MET) |
| `process_by` | `TIMESTAMPTZ` | Yes | The threshold itself (clinical time): the due date, due date + tolerance-days, or the beating `completed_at` |
| `is_processed`, `processed_at`, `processed_by`, `attempts`, `next_attempt_at` | — | No | Step SLA work-queue bookkeeping |

Insights reads `process_by` of `DUE_DATE_REACHED` / `MISSED_DATE_REACHED` as the clinical occurrence
date of OVERDUE / MISSED deviations (§3.1a) and as `overdueDate` / `missedDate` in the protocol-tracking
detail (1.x `step_instance.overdue_date` / `missed_date`).

### 1.4 `deviation`

Recorded deviations from protocol pathways.

| Column | Type | Used By Insights | Purpose |
|--------|------|------------------|---------|
| `id` | `UUID` | Yes | PK |
| `step_instance_id` | `UUID` | Yes | FK → `step_instance.id` — also the only way to the enrollment (`step_instance.protocol_instance_id`) since 2.0.0 dropped `deviation.protocol_instance_id` |
| `deviation_type` | `VARCHAR` | Yes | `OVERDUE`, `MISSED` (Step SLA Service) or `ORDER_VIOLATION` (Matcher) — at most one row per (step, type) |
| `detected_at` | `TIMESTAMPTZ` | Yes | When deviation was detected |
| `metadata` | `JSONB` | Yes | Additional context (due date, overdue date) |

### 1.5 `event_log`

Inbound clinical event audit trail. Queried for patient timeline views and **event volume analytics**.

| Column | Type | Used By Insights | Purpose |
|--------|------|------------------|---------|  
| `id` | `UUID` | Yes | PK |
| `cloudevents_id` | `VARCHAR` | No | CloudEvents ID (used for idempotency by the Matcher Service) |
| `subject` | `VARCHAR` | Yes | Patient UPID — filter key |
| `type` | `VARCHAR` | Yes | CloudEvents `type` for display |
| `event_time` | `TIMESTAMPTZ` | Yes | Clinical event timestamp |
| `received_at` | `TIMESTAMPTZ` | Yes | Server ingestion timestamp |
| `source` | `VARCHAR` | Yes | Origin system (e.g., `rhie-mediator`, `ebuzima/kigali-south`) — group-by key for source system metrics |
| `data` | `JSONB` | Yes | Full CloudEvent data payload. Contains `resourceType` (group-by key) and practitioner references (extracted via JSONB path queries). See §3.3 for extraction paths. |
| `processing_status` | `VARCHAR` | Yes | `MATCHED`, `ZERO_MATCH`, `DUPLICATE` — used for processing quality metrics |
| `facility_id` | `VARCHAR` | Yes | Facility FOSA ID — group-by key for facility metrics |
| `protocol_instance_id` | `UUID` | Yes | Matched protocol instance (NULL for zero-match/duplicate) |
| `protocol_definition_id` | `UUID` | Yes | Matched protocol definition (NULL for zero-match/duplicate) |
| `action_id` | `VARCHAR` | Yes | Matched PlanDefinition action ID |
| `matched_step_instance_id` | `UUID` | Yes | Step completed by this event |

### 1.6 `inbound_event`

Request audit log & rejection tracking. Owned by the **Collector Service** — every HTTP request is persisted as-is before processing. Used for ingestion funnel, rejection analytics, source data quality, and pipeline loss detection.

| Column | Type | Used By Insights | Purpose |
|--------|------|------------------|---------|
| `id` | `UUID` | Yes | PK (UUIDv7, time-ordered) |
| `cloudevents_id` | `VARCHAR` | Yes | CloudEvents `id` — used for pipeline loss detection (JOIN to `event_log`) |

| `spec_version` | `VARCHAR` | No | Always "1.0" |
| `subject` | `VARCHAR` | Yes | Patient UPID |
| `event_time` | `TIMESTAMPTZ` | Yes | Source-provided event time |
| `data_content_type` | `VARCHAR` | No | MIME type of data payload |
| `facility_id` | `VARCHAR` | Yes | Facility FOSA ID — filter key |
| `correlation_id` | `VARCHAR` | No | Distributed tracing ID |
| `source_event_id` | `VARCHAR` | No | Source system's internal event ID |
| `raw_payload` | `JSONB` | Yes | Full original request body — resourceType extracted via `raw_payload->'data'->>'resourceType'` |
| `status` | `VARCHAR` | Yes | `RECEIVED`, `ACCEPTED`, `REJECTED`, `DUPLICATE` — group-by key for funnel metrics |
| `rejection_reason` | `VARCHAR` | Yes | Rejection reason code (if status = REJECTED) — group-by key for rejection analytics |
| `error_details` | `TEXT` | No | Stack trace or validation error messages |
| `received_at` | `TIMESTAMPTZ` | Yes | Server-side receipt timestamp (UTC) — filter + sort key |

> **Deduplication constraint:** `UNIQUE(cloudevents_id, source)` — primary deduplication key.

### 1.7 `intelligence_delivery`

Intelligence action delivery records. Owned by the **Intelligence Service**. Used for tracking fire-event actions, escalation notifications, and delivery status.

| Column | Type | Used By Insights | Purpose |
|--------|------|------------------|---------|
| `id` | `UUID` | Yes | PK |
| `intelligence_event_id` | `VARCHAR` | Yes | Intelligence event identifier |
| `action_definition_id` | `VARCHAR` | Yes | Protocol action definition reference |
| `destination_adaptor_mapping_id` | `UUID` | Yes | FK → `destination_adaptor_mapping.id` |

| `updated_at` | `TIMESTAMPTZ` | No | Last update |

### 1.10 `facility` (schema/01 — CDC-sourced from the matcher service)

Facility roster auto-registered by the matcher service from inbound FHIR events. Defines the
denominator for facility activity metrics and the e-Buzima adoption baseline. Populated via Debezium
CDC: `PostgreSQL → Kafka (cce.public.facility) → ClickHouse`.
Engine: `ReplacingMergeTree(_version, _is_deleted)` ORDER BY `(id)` — dedup uses Debezium LSN as
version; deleted facilities are physically removed on background merge (`clean_deleted_rows = Always`).
Always read with `FINAL` to see the deduplicated, delete-purged view.

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `id` | `UUID` | PostgreSQL primary key — ReplacingMergeTree ORDER BY key |
| `facility_id` | `String` | HIE-assigned facility identifier — UNIQUE in source |
| `facility_name` | `String` | Display name from FHIR Reference.display |
| `expected_patients_per_day` | `UInt32` | Daily patient throughput baseline for adoption calculation; 0 = not configured |
| `created_at` | `DateTime64(6)` | Row creation timestamp from the matcher service |
| `updated_at` | `DateTime64(6)` | Last update timestamp — reflects matcher service update |
| `_version` | `UInt64` | Debezium source.lsn — monotonic version for ReplacingMergeTree dedup |
| `_is_deleted` | `UInt8` | 1 when source row was DELETEd in PostgreSQL |

### 1.11 Daily KPI Materialized Views (schema/07)

Five refreshable MVs that snapshot compliance, adoption, deviation, event pipeline, and
referral KPIs every 30 seconds. (Compliance is APPEND-mode now()-snapshots; adoption, deviation,
event and referral are event_time-keyed full-recompute over a 12-month rolling window, so backdated
events self-heal.) Backing tables use `ReplacingMergeTree(refreshed_at)` with `snapshot_date` as the first
ORDER BY key, so within a day multiple refresh rows deduplicate to the latest (use `FINAL`), and
across days all snapshots are preserved.

Always filter with `FINAL` and `WHERE snapshot_date = today()` for the current day's snapshot.

**`mv_daily_compliance_kpis`** — one row per `(snapshot_date, protocol_definition_id)`

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `snapshot_date` | Calendar day of the snapshot |
| `refreshed_at` | Refresh timestamp — version for ReplacingMergeTree dedup |
| `protocol_definition_id` | UUID of the protocol |
| `total_enrollments`, `status_active`, `status_completed`, `status_withdrawn`, `status_expired` | Enrollment status breakdown |
| `tracked_patients`, `compliant_count`, `non_compliant_count`, `compliance_rate_pct` | Patient compliance summary |
| `total_deviations`, `overdue_deviations`, `missed_deviations`, `order_violation_deviations` | Deviation breakdown |
| `step_total` | All steps of the protocol's live enrollments |
| `step_completed`, `step_not_started` | Split by `step_status` (`step_completed` no longer includes SKIPPED, which 2.0.0 dropped) |
| `step_sla_met`, `step_sla_overdue`, `step_sla_missed`, `step_sla_unjudged` | Split by `sla_status` (`step_sla_overdue` / `step_sla_missed` include steps completed after the threshold; `unjudged` = `''`) |
| `step_completed_on_time`, `step_completed_late` | `COMPLETED + MET` and `COMPLETED + OVERDUE|MISSED` |

> **Removed in 2.0.0:** `step_overdue`, `step_missed`, `step_due`, `step_pending`, `step_on_time`,
> `step_early`, `step_late`. Due and pending are no longer distinguishable (both are "outstanding, not
> yet judged"), and early / on-time both became `MET`. These columns back `ComplianceSummaryDto.StepMetrics`
> one-to-one (see API reference).

> **Removed:** `mv_daily_facility_kpis` and `mv_daily_facility_activity_summary` were
> dropped. The Facilities ranking is now computed live from the enrolled-patient cohort
> joined to `inbound_event_logs`, and the active-facility tiles read
> `mv_event_volume_hourly` (event_time-keyed) — see §3.9 and §3.13a.

**`mv_daily_adoption_kpis`** — one row per `(snapshot_date, facility_id)`, joined with `facility`

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `snapshot_date` | Calendar day |
| `facility_id` | FOSA facility ID |
| `facility_name` | From `facility` |
| `expected_patients_per_day` | From `facility` |
| `actual_patients` | Distinct patients with a compliance event at this facility on this day |
| `adoption_rate_pct` | `actual_patients / expected_patients_per_day × 100` |
| `reporting_gap` | `expected_patients_per_day − actual_patients` |

**`mv_daily_deviation_kpis`** — one row per `(snapshot_date, protocol_definition_id)`

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `snapshot_date` | Calendar day |
| `protocol_definition_id` | UUID of the protocol |
| `total_deviations`, `overdue_count`, `missed_count`, `order_violation_count` | Daily snapshot deviation counts |

> **Important — date-range queries must not SUM this MV.** Each daily row is a *stock*
> snapshot (open deviations as of that day), not a flow of new deviations, so summing
> across days double-counts deviations that remain open. The Deviations page header
> instead counts distinct rows from the `deviations` base table filtered by
> `detected_at` — see `DeviationRepository.countByTypeFiltered`. **RI-34**'s
> `findDeviationsByFacilityAndType` (the "Deviations by Facility and Type" chart) follows
> the same rule — it queries the raw `deviations` table via `mv_patient_facility_latest`,
> not this MV.

**`mv_daily_event_kpis`** — one row per `snapshot_date` (global pipeline summary)

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `snapshot_date` | Calendar day |
| `total_events` | Total events received (from `mv_event_volume_hourly`) |
| `matched_count`, `zero_match_count`, `duplicate_count` | Processing status breakdown |
| `matched_rate_pct`, `zero_match_rate_pct` | Processing quality rates |
| `pipeline_loss_count` | `total_events − total_processed` |

**`mv_daily_referral_kpis`** — one row per `(event_time day, facility_id)`

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `snapshot_date` | Clinical `event_time` day of the referral |
| `facility_id` | FOSA facility ID |
| `referral_count` | **Referrals received by HIE** — ACCEPTED inbound referral events on this day. Prod: an `Encounter` whose `Encounter.type[].coding[].display = 'TRANSFER_ENCOUNTER'` (ingestion-based, match-independent). Dev/demo fallback: an accepted event that completed a Referral step (the demo referral is a markerless `ServiceRequest`). Deduped so prod never double-counts. |
| `matched_count` | Of those received, the ones matched to (that completed) a Referral step — the **"compliant"** referrals. Non-compliant = `referral_count − matched_count`. |

> Keyed on clinical `event_time` (not `received_at`), so it is a functional/clinical metric.
> **Ingestion-based** (RI-35): counts every accepted transfer the HIE received, independent of whether
> the matcher matched it — so it no longer under-reports (transfers for not-yet-enrolled
> patients) or lags behind step matching / CDC. Backs the `GET /v1/insights/dashboard/referrals` KPI:
> Received by HIE, Compliant (matched), Non-Compliant (received − matched) and Referral Compliance Rate
> (matched ÷ received), plus a per-facility breakdown with district.

## 2. Enum Values

### 2.1 `ProtocolInstanceStatus`

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `ACTIVE` | Protocol enrollment is ongoing |
| `COMPLETED` | All steps completed |
| `WITHDRAWN` | Enrollment cancelled |
| `EXPIRED` | Protocol expired without completion |

### 2.2 `StepStatus` (`step_instance.step_status`, Matcher Service)

|-------|-------------|
| `NOT_STARTED` | The expected event has not arrived |
| `COMPLETED` | Completed by a matched event (terminal) |

### 2.3 `SlaStatus` (`step_instance.sla_status`, Step SLA Service)

|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| *(null / `''`)* | Not yet judged — no threshold reached yet, or an optional step | on_track |
| `OVERDUE` | Due date passed before completion | at_risk |
| `MISSED` | Due date + tolerance passed before completion (written off) | non_compliant |
| `MET` | Completed on or before the due date | on_track |

**1.x → 2.0.0 mapping** (`StepState` and `CompletionStatus` were removed):

| `MISSED` | `NOT_STARTED` + `MISSED` |
| `COMPLETED` + `EARLY` / `ON_TIME` | `COMPLETED` + `MET` |
| `COMPLETED` + `LATE` | `COMPLETED` + `OVERDUE` (late) or `MISSED` (after write-off) |
| `SKIPPED` | — (no longer exists) |

The patient views show one badge per step, `StepInstance.displayStatus()`: `COMPLETED`, else the
outstanding step's `OVERDUE` / `MISSED`, else `NOT_STARTED`.

### 2.4 `DeviationType`

| Value | Description | Severity Mapping |

---

## 3. Aggregation Formulas

### 3.1 Compliance Rate

```
compliance_rate = completed_steps / total_steps
```

Where `completed_steps` counts `step_status = 'COMPLETED'` (whatever the `sla_status`; 1.x also counted `SKIPPED`, which no longer exists). `total_steps` counts all step instances for the protocol instance.

### 3.1a Deviation Occurrence Date

Deviation metrics are bucketed on when the deviation clinically **happened**, not `detected_at`:

```
occurred_at = coalesce(
    multiIf(deviation_type = 'OVERDUE',         DUE_DATE_REACHED.process_by,
            deviation_type = 'MISSED',          MISSED_DATE_REACHED.process_by,
            deviation_type = 'ORDER_VIOLATION', step_instance.completed_at),
    step_instance.due_date,
    deviation.detected_at)
```

The thresholds come from `step_sla_state_transition` (1.x read `step_instance.overdue_date` /
`missed_date`). Same resolution as the pipeline's `mv_daily_deviation_kpis`.

### 3.2 Deviation Severity Mapping

| Deviation Type | Severity |
|---|---|
| `OVERDUE` | `warning` |
| `MISSED` | `critical` |

### 3.3 Practitioner Reference Extraction (JSONB)

Practitioner references are embedded within the `event_log.data` JSONB column at resource-type-specific paths. The Insights Service uses `COALESCE` across multiple JSONB paths to extract the practitioner reference regardless of resource type.

| Resource Type | Reference Path | Display Path |
|---|---|---|
| `Encounter` | `data->'participant'->0->'individual'->>'reference'` | `data->'participant'->0->'individual'->>'display'` |
| `Observation` | `data->'performer'->0->>'reference'` | `data->'performer'->0->>'display'` |
| `Condition` | `data->'asserter'->>'reference'` | `data->'asserter'->>'display'` |
| `MedicationRequest` | `data->'requester'->>'reference'` | `data->'requester'->>'display'` |
| `MedicationDispense` | `data->'performer'->0->'actor'->>'reference'` | `data->'performer'->0->'actor'->>'display'` |
| `MedicationAdministration` | `data->'performer'->0->'actor'->>'reference'` | `data->'performer'->0->'actor'->>'display'` |
| `ServiceRequest` | `data->'requester'->>'reference'` | `data->'requester'->>'display'` |
| `Procedure` | `data->'performer'->0->'actor'->>'reference'` | `data->'performer'->0->'actor'->>'display'` |
| `Immunization` | `data->'performer'->0->'actor'->>'reference'` | `data->'performer'->0->'actor'->>'display'` |

**Unified extraction expression:**
```sql
COALESCE(
  data->'participant'->0->'individual'->>'reference',   -- Encounter
  data->'performer'->0->>'reference',                    -- Observation
  data->'asserter'->>'reference',                        -- Condition
  data->'requester'->>'reference',                       -- MedicationRequest, ServiceRequest
  data->'performer'->0->'actor'->>'reference'            -- MedicationDispense, Procedure, Immunization
) AS practitioner_ref
```

> **Note:** If a source system does not include practitioner references in event payloads, those events will have `NULL` practitioner_ref and will be excluded from practitioner-grouped metrics. The `display` field is best-effort — availability depends on source system behavior.

### 3.4 Event Volume Formulas

```
event_count_by_resource_type = COUNT(*) FROM event_log WHERE processing_status != 'DUPLICATE' GROUP BY data->>'resourceType'

event_percentage = (resource_type_count / total_non_duplicate_events) * 100

processing_status_breakdown (in events/summary):
  For each status in [MATCHED, ZERO_MATCH, DUPLICATE]:
    count = COUNT(processing_status = status)
    percentage = ROUND(count / total_events * 100, 1)
  Returns: { matched: {count, percentage}, zeroMatch: {count, percentage}, duplicate: {count, percentage} }
```

### 3.5 Step Analytics Formulas

```
completion_rate = completed_count / total_instances          -- completed = step_status 'COMPLETED'

-- per action, distinct patients:
completed_on_time = step_status 'COMPLETED' AND sla_status 'MET'
completed_late    = step_status 'COMPLETED' AND sla_status IN ('OVERDUE','MISSED')
overdue / missed  = sla_status 'OVERDUE' / 'MISSED'         -- includes steps completed late
not_started       = step_status 'NOT_STARTED'
sla_unjudged      = sla_status ''

avg_days_to_complete = AVG(completed_at - due_date) in days  -- only for COMPLETED steps with a due_date

median_days_to_complete = PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY (completed_at - due_date))
    -- only for COMPLETED steps with a due_date
```

### 3.6 Completion Funnel Formulas

```
reached_count = COUNT(DISTINCT patient_id) with a step_instance for this action_id (any status)

completed_count = COUNT(DISTINCT patient_id) with step_status = 'COMPLETED' for this action_id

completion_rate = completed_count / reached_count

drop_off_rate = 1 - completion_rate
```

> **Step ordering:** `stepOrder` is derived from the `PlanDefinition.action[]` array ordering and `relatedAction` dependencies defined in the protocol definition. The first step is enrollment itself.

### 3.7 Outcome Distribution Formulas

```
percentage = (status_count / total_instances) * 100
```

Where `status` is one of `ACTIVE`, `COMPLETED`, `WITHDRAWN`, `EXPIRED` from `protocol_instance.status`.

### 3.8 Enrollment Trend Formulas

```
enrollments = COUNT(*) FROM protocol_instance
    WHERE protocol_definition_id = :id
    GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC(:interval, enrolled_at)
```

Supported intervals: `daily`, `weekly`, `monthly`.

### 3.9 Facility Ranking Formulas

```
tracked_patients     = uniq(protocol_instance.patient_id) joined with mv_patient_facility_latest
                       (optionally constrained to enrolled_at in selected period)

compliance_rate      = (tracked − non_compliant) / tracked × 100 per facility
                       (non_compliant = uniq patients with any deviation in period)

active_deviations    = uniq patients with any deviation in period, computed live from the
                       same enrolled-patient cohort as compliance_rate (shared cohort keeps
                       deviations consistent with the rate; the former
                       mv_daily_facility_kpis source was dropped)

total_events         = uniq inbound_event_logs.id with status='ACCEPTED' in the period,
                       intersected with the facility reference list
                       (replaces the earlier mv_daily_facility_kpis.event_count path,
                        which only counted compliance-matched events)
```

The events column on the ranking table is intentionally sourced from
`inbound_event_logs` so it matches the Active Facilities tile and the Events → By Facility
table; otherwise a facility that submits accepted-but-unmatched HIE events would appear
active with zero ranked events.

Ranking options (`rankBy` parameter):
| Value | Sort Expression |
|---|---|
| `complianceRate` | `compliance_rate` DESC (best first) or ASC (worst first) |
| `deviationCount` | `active_deviations` ASC (best first) or DESC (worst first) |
| `eventVolume` | `total_events` DESC or ASC |

### 3.10 Deviation By-Action Formulas

```
total_deviations = COUNT(*) FROM deviation WHERE step_instance.action_id = :actionId

overdue_count = COUNT(*) WHERE deviation_type = 'OVERDUE'
missed_count  = COUNT(*) WHERE deviation_type = 'MISSED'

affected_patients = COUNT(DISTINCT protocol_instance.patient_id)
```

### 3.11 Deviation Resolution Rate Formulas

Resolution is determined by tracking the current status of step instances that had an `OVERDUE` deviation:

```
resolved  = step_instance.step_status is 'COMPLETED' (completed after all, whatever the sla_status)
escalated = step_instance.step_status is 'NOT_STARTED' AND sla_status is 'MISSED' (written off)

resolution_rate = resolved_count / total_overdue_deviations

avg_days_to_resolve = AVG(step_instance.completed_at - deviation.detected_at) in days
    -- only for resolved (COMPLETED) overdue steps
```

### 3.12 Processing Quality Formulas

```
matched_rate   = COUNT(processing_status = 'MATCHED')   / total_events * 100
zero_match_rate = COUNT(processing_status = 'ZERO_MATCH') / total_events * 100
duplicate_rate  = COUNT(processing_status = 'DUPLICATE')  / total_events * 100
```

Breakdowns are computed per `source` system. A high `ZERO_MATCH` rate indicates misconfigured emitters or protocols that don't cover incoming event types.

### 3.13 At-Risk Hotspot Formulas

Patient compliance category is binary across **all active protocol instances** at a
facility (the legacy `at_risk` middle tier was retired — every patient is either
compliant or non-compliant in the analytics surface):

```
on_track       = patient has NO deviation rows in the selected period
non_compliant  = patient has ≥1 deviation row in the selected period

percentage = category_count / total_patients_at_facility * 100
```

> The hotspot endpoint still emits a 3-tier label for backwards compatibility, but the
> Dashboard, Compliance Overview, and Patient List all use the binary model above.

> **Note:** Facility is derived by joining `protocol_instance` → `event_log.facility_id`.

> **RI-36 — Dashboard "Service Compliance" tracked cohort (event activity, not `enrolled_at`):**
> The Dashboard patient tile (`GET /dashboard/compliance-summary`, computed live in
> `DashboardService.getComplianceSummary`) no longer scopes `tracked_patients` by
> `enrolled_at`. **Tracked** = distinct `inbound_event_logs.subject` for `ACCEPTED` events
> with `event_time` in the period whose `cloudevents_id` matched a protocol
> (`matcher_event_logs.processing_status = 'MATCHED'`) — i.e. events *considered by a
> protocol*, whether they created a new enrollment or advanced an existing journey. This
> counts a patient enrolled in a prior period who is active again in the window (the old
> `enrolled_at` cohort dropped them) and excludes Consent-only / unmatched events.
> **Non-compliant** = of that cohort, patients with ≥1 deviation whose **clinical occurrence
> date** (§3.1 occurrence clock, not `detected_at`) is in range. Compliant = tracked −
> non-compliant; rate = compliant ÷ tracked. Per-protocol `mv_daily_compliance_kpis`
> (enrollment-based) is unchanged.
>
> The **Facility Ranking** compliance breakdown (`ProtocolInstanceRepository.countPatient-
> ComplianceByFacility`, backing `GET /facilities/rankings`) uses the **same** matched-event
> cohort so card and breakdown reconcile by definition. Patients are attributed to their
> current facility via `mv_patient_facility_latest`; a tracked patient with no resolved
> facility there appears in the country card but not in any facility row, so the breakdown's
> tracked total can be lower than the card's country total (facility-attribution gap, not
> double-counting).
>
> The `GET /protocols[/{id}]/compliance-summary` endpoints take a `dateFilterMode`:
> **`enrollment`** (default, cohort = `enrolled_at` in range) and **`eventTime`** — user-facing
> label **"Clinical Event Date"** (RI-36). In `eventTime` mode the all-protocols patient block
> reuses the exact card queries (reconciles with the card); the per-protocol path uses
> `findByProtocolDefinitionIdWithActivityBetween`, now keyed on clinical **`event_time`** of a
> protocol-MATCHED event (was step `updated_at`, a system write time). Because
> `matcher_event_logs` has no protocol column (only `cloudevents_id` / `processing_status` /
> `correlation_id`, and `correlation_id` matches neither `protocol_instances.id` nor
> `step_instances.id`), per-protocol `eventTime` is "enrolled in protocol X **AND** has a matched
> event in range", not "events matched to protocol X".
>
> **Naming (important):** `eventTime` / "Clinical Event Date" is the CLINICAL event clock
> (`inbound_event_logs.event_time`). It is **distinct** from the system `updated_at` "activity"
> that the Patient detail page's activity log shows (when CCE processed a record) — the value was
> renamed from `activity`→`eventTime` and the label to "Clinical Event Date" specifically to avoid
> that confusion. The **Compliance Overview** page has no toggle (always `eventTime`); the
> **Patients** page has the Enrollment / Clinical Event Date radio (default Clinical Event Date)
> and shares this same query.

### 3.13a Facility Activity Formulas

A facility is **active** if it has ≥1 `ACCEPTED` inbound event (event_time-keyed) in the
period — the same "any accepted event" definition eBuzima Adoption's actual-visits count uses
(`mv_daily_adoption_kpis`), so a facility with recorded activity is never shown Inactive just
because the matcher hasn't (or never will) match that event to a protocol step.

> **Changed (RI-62):** this previously required the event to *also* be matched to a protocol
> (`matcher_event_logs.processing_status='MATCHED'`), on the theory that "active" should mean
> "contributing to a tracked care journey" (keeping it consistent with the Facility Ranking
> "tracked patients" cohort). That made Active/Inactive diverge from Adoption whenever the
> matcher lagged or had a gap: a facility with real, recorded eBuzima visits
> (`ACCEPTED`, unmatched) would show "Inactive" while its own Adoption row showed non-zero Actual
> Visits — confusing, and arguably wrong, since connectivity/activity and protocol-tracking are
> different concepts. Active is now accepted-only again, matching Adoption; "tracked patients" on
> the Ranking table remains matched-only (unchanged) since that's a genuinely different question
> ("is this patient in a tracked care journey", not "did this facility transmit anything").

```
total_in_scope       = COUNT(*) FROM facility FINAL WHERE _is_deleted = 0

active_facilities    = uniq(facility_id) FROM inbound_event_logs
                       WHERE status = 'ACCEPTED' AND facility_id != ''
                         AND facility_id IN (facility reference)
                         AND toDate(event_time) BETWEEN startDate AND endDate
                       (toDate(event_time) = today() when no range)

inactive_facilities  = total_in_scope − active_facilities

active_facility_rate = active_facilities / total_in_scope × 100
```

> Note: `inactive` now means "no accepted events at all" in the period — same population as
> zero `totalEvents` on the Facility Ranking table and zero Actual Visits on Adoption.

> The denominator (`total_in_scope`) comes from `facility`, not from observed event data.
> This ensures facilities that transmitted no events in the period are counted as inactive
> (not omitted).

**RI-29 drill-down detail** (`GET /v1/insights/facilities/activity-detail`, one row per
in-scope facility — see API reference §9.3):

```
active[facility]        = facility_id ∈ active_facilities (same definition as above,
                           scoped to [startDate, endDate])

last_activity[facility] = toString(max(toDate(hour))) FROM mv_event_volume_hourly
                           WHERE facility_id = :facility_id AND toDate(hour) <= endDate
                           (NO lower bound — unlike `active`, which IS bounded by startDate)
```

> `last_activity` deliberately has no start-date floor: an inactive-in-period facility
> that transmitted before the window still shows its true last-seen day instead of a
> blank. It is `null` only for a facility never active up to `endDate`. The per-facility
> rows (facility name, district, active flag, last activity) are combined in Java rather
> than via a `LEFT JOIN`, to avoid ClickHouse filling unmatched join columns with
> zero-value defaults instead of `NULL`.

### 3.13b e-Buzima Adoption Formulas (mv_daily_adoption_kpis)

```
actual_patients   = COUNT(DISTINCT patient_id) FROM matcher_event_logs
                    WHERE facility_id = :facility_id AND toDate(event_time) = snapshot_date

adoption_rate_pct = actual_patients / expected_patients_per_day × 100
                    (0 when expected_patients_per_day = 0)

reporting_gap     = expected_patients_per_day − actual_patients
                    (negative = over-reporting; positive = under-reporting)
```

Multi-day (date-range) aggregation (via `DailyKpiRepository.getAdoptionKpisByDateRange`):

**RI-33 — period totals, not per-day.** The API response reports the expected and actual
visit counts **over the whole selected period**. The expected figure scales with the number
of days selected (baseline/day × days), so it is no longer a fixed per-1-day number.

```
calendar_days   = (endDate − startDate) + 1
baseline_per_day = max(expected_patients_per_day)
total_actual    = SUM(actual_patients) across MV rows in range

expectedVisits  = baseline_per_day × calendar_days
actualVisits    = round(total_actual)
reportingGap    = expectedVisits − actualVisits
adoptionRate(%) = total_actual / (baseline_per_day × calendar_days) × 100
                  (forced to 0 when baseline_per_day = 0 AND actualVisits = 0)
```

> For a single-day snapshot (`calendar_days = 1`) `expectedVisits` equals the daily
> baseline, so the today view is unchanged. Days without an MV row simply contribute `0`
> to `total_actual` — a facility with sparse reporting is not over-credited.
>
> **Zero-baseline override:** a facility with no expected baseline and no actual visits
> reports `adoptionRate = 0.0`, never a vacuous `100.0` — an unbaselined, inactive
> facility hasn't "adopted" anything. Separately, a facility with **no adoption row at
> all** for the period (`emptyAdoptionDto`) always reports `adoptionRate = 0.0` too,
> regardless of whether it has an expected baseline (previously this case returned
> `100.0` when `expected = 0`, which read as a false "fully adopted").

### 3.14 Repeat Deviation Formulas

```
total_deviations  = COUNT(*) FROM deviation per patient_id
overdue_count     = COUNT(deviation_type = 'OVERDUE') per patient_id
missed_count      = COUNT(deviation_type = 'MISSED') per patient_id
affected_protocols = COUNT(DISTINCT protocol_instance.id) per patient_id
affected_steps    = COUNT(DISTINCT deviation.step_instance_id) per patient_id
```

Only patients with `total_deviations >= :minDeviations` (default 3) are included.

## 6. FHIR Resource Types (Event Volume)

The following FHIR resource types are commonly observed in `event_log.data->>'resourceType'` across RHIE and CHW integrations. The Insights Service does not restrict or validate resource types — it groups by whatever values exist in the data.

| Resource Type | Clinical Context | Typical Volume |
|---|---|---|
| `Encounter` | Visit registration, consultations, transfers | High |
| `Observation` | Vital signs, lab results, chief complaints, clinical findings | High |
| `Condition` | Diagnoses (ICD-11) | Medium |
| `MedicationRequest` | Prescriptions (e-Prescription) | Medium |
| `MedicationDispense` | Pharmacy dispensing | Medium |
| `MedicationAdministration` | Medication given to patient | Low–Medium |
| `ServiceRequest` | Lab orders, imaging orders, referrals | Medium |
| `Procedure` | Clinical procedures (ICHI codes) | Low |
| `Immunization` | Vaccinations (NPC codes) | Low–Medium |
| `AllergyIntolerance` | Allergy records | Low |
| `ImagingStudy` | Imaging results (DICOM) | Low |
| `DiagnosticReport` | Lab and imaging reports | Low |
| `Consent` | Patient consent records | Low |

> **Note:** Non-FHIR events (`datacontenttype: application/json`) do not have a `resourceType` field. These will appear as `null` in resource type groupings and should be filtered or grouped separately.
