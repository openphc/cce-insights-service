# Release Notes

## Unreleased

### CCE 2.0.0 ClickHouse schema (breaking API changes)

Reads the 2.0.0 `cce_analytics` schema (Protocol / Matcher / Step SLA services replace the 1.x
Compliance Service). ClickHouse is rebuilt from PostgreSQL for 2.0.0 — no 1.x data compatibility.

- **Schema:** `compliance_event_logs` → `matcher_event_logs`; `step_instances.state` /
  `completion_status` → `step_status` (NOT_STARTED | COMPLETED) + `sla_status` ('' | OVERDUE |
  MISSED | MET); `completed_by_event_id` → `matched_event_id`; `overdue_date` / `missed_date` →
  `step_sla_state_transitions.process_by`; `protocol_instances.protocol_canonical` and
  `deviations.protocol_instance_id` dropped (rebuilt by joining `protocol_definitions` /
  `step_instances`); `mv_daily_compliance_kpis` step columns replaced. jOOQ classes regenerated.
- **`stepMetrics`** (`/protocols[/{id}]/compliance-summary`): removed `onTime`, `early`, `late`,
  `due`, `pending`; added `notStarted`, `slaMet`, `slaUnjudged`, `completedOnTime`, `completedLate`.
  `completed` no longer includes SKIPPED; `overdue` / `missed` are SLA verdicts that now include
  steps completed after the threshold.
- **Step analytics** (`/protocols/{id}/step-analytics`): `timelinessDistribution` is
  `{completedOnTime, completedLate}` (was `{early, onTime, late}`); removed `skippedCount`,
  `pendingCount`; added `notStartedCount`, `slaUnjudgedCount`; `overdueCount` / `missedCount` are SLA
  verdicts.
- **Patient compliance timeline:** journey rows and timeline events gain `stepStatus` + `slaStatus`
  and lose `completionStatus`; `status` / `state` values are now COMPLETED | OVERDUE | MISSED |
  NOT_STARTED (no PENDING / DUE / SKIPPED), and event `type` follows (`step_not_started`).
- **Protocol-tracking detail:** steps carry `stepStatus` + `slaStatus` instead of `state` +
  `completionStatus`; `overdueDate` / `missedDate` are the scheduled SLA thresholds.
- **Exports:** `overdue_steps` / `missed_steps` count SLA verdicts (include late completions).
- Deviation occurrence date (Deviations page, compliance deviation cards, facility ranking) reads the
  breached threshold from `step_sla_state_transitions`, matching the pipeline's `mv_daily_deviation_kpis`.

### Deviations by Facility and Type (RI-34)

- **New endpoint `GET /v1/insights/deviations/by-facility`** — backs the Deviations page's
  "Deviations by Facility and Type" chart. Facilities ranked by deviation count, broken down into
  overdue/missed/order-violation, cursor-paginated, scoped by `facilityId`/`district`/
  `protocolDefinitionId`/date range, and re-rankable by a single type via `deviationType`
  (defaults to ranking by total).
- `DeviationRepository.findDeviationsByFacilityAndType` follows the same raw-`deviations`-table
  attribution as the existing `countDeviationsByFacility` (via `mv_patient_facility_latest`),
  **not** `mv_daily_deviation_kpis` — summing that daily snapshot table across a date range
  double-counts deviations that stay `OVERDUE` across multiple days (same pitfall already
  documented for `countByTypeFiltered`).
- Sort column is whitelisted server-side (`SORT_COLUMNS` in `DeviationRepositoryImpl`) — the
  `deviationType` query param is never interpolated directly into `ORDER BY`.

### Global Facility Filter Parity + Ingestion District Support (RI-56)

- **District filtering added to the Ingestion Analytics pipeline** — previously the only page
  with no district support at all. `district` param added to `InboundEventRepository`/`Impl`
  (`countByStatus`, `countByRejectionReason`, `countBySourceAndStatus`,
  `findPipelineLossBySource`, `countPipelineLoss`, `countAcceptedByReceivedAt`), threaded through
  `IngestionAnalyticsService.getIngestionFunnel/getRejectionAnalytics/getSourceDataQuality/getPipelineLoss/getLastIngestedEvent`,
  and exposed on `IngestionAnalyticsController` (`/funnel`, `/rejections`, `/source-quality`,
  `/pipeline-loss`, `/last-event`). Uses the same `districtScope(facilityColumn, district)`
  helper already used across the rest of the codebase.
- **Bug fix — `@Cacheable` keys missing `district`/`interval`:** the four cached Ingestion
  service methods had their `district` (and `getIngestionFunnel`'s `interval`) parameter added
  to the method signature, but the `@Cacheable` SpEL key expressions weren't updated to include
  it — so Spring's cache returned the same result regardless of which district/interval was
  requested. Fixed all 4 key expressions.
- **Bug fix — `findLastReceivedAt` returning epoch instead of `null` for empty scopes:**
  ClickHouse's `max()` over zero matching rows returns the column type's zero-value
  (`1970-01-01T00:00:00Z`), not SQL `NULL`, since `received_at` is a non-nullable `DateTime64`.
  A district/facility combination with genuinely no events showed "Jan 1, 1970" instead of "—".
  Fixed by selecting `count()` alongside `max()` and returning `null` explicitly when the count
  is zero.
- **Bug fix — `FacilityActivityController.getActivitySummary` branch-order bug:** `district` was
  checked before `facilityId`, so a combined `facilityId=X&district=Y` request silently dropped
  the facility filter and returned district-only totals. Reordered so `facilityId` (the more
  specific filter) is checked first, and added explicit handling for a self-contradictory
  combination (facility doesn't belong to the given district) — returns an all-zero summary
  rather than either filter silently winning. New regression coverage:
  `FacilityActivityControllerIT`.

### Facility Active/Inactive Derivation (RI-62)

- **Active/Inactive facility status is accepted-only again** — reverted the requirement that
  an inbound event also be protocol-matched (`compliance_event_logs.processing_status='MATCHED'`)
  to count as "active". A facility is now active if it has ≥1 `ACCEPTED` inbound event in the
  period, same definition as eBuzima Adoption's actual-visits count. This fixes a case where a
  facility with real recorded activity showed "Inactive" purely because the compliance-matching
  pipeline hadn't (or couldn't) match those events to a protocol step — connectivity/activity and
  protocol-tracking are different concepts and shouldn't share one flag. Affects
  `GET /v1/insights/facilities/activity-summary` and `/activity-detail`
  (`DailyKpiRepositoryImpl.getFacilityActivitySummary`, `getFacilityActivitySummaryByDateRange`,
  `getFacilityActivityDetail`); cascades to the Dashboard "Total Facilities" tile and the Facility
  Ranking Status column. See `docs/data-dictionary.md` §3.13a for the updated formula and the
  full history of this derivation.
- **Facility Ranking table gets an "Events" column** — surfaces `FacilityRankingDto.totalEvents`
  (already computed, accepted-only, previously fetched but not rendered on this table).

### Referrals KPI (new)

- **`GET /v1/insights/dashboard/referrals`** — new dashboard endpoint returning
  `ReferralsKpiDto` (`totalReferralsReceived` + `byFacility[]` of
  `{ facilityId, facilityName, count }`). Counts **ACCEPTED** inbound events (scoped by
  clinical `event_time`) that completed a *Referral Initiated* step, backed by the new
  `mv_daily_referral_kpis` materialized view (event_time day × facility; `referral_count`).
  Accepts `facilityId`, `startDate`, `endDate` (`OffsetDateTime`).

### Metric Time Semantics

- Documented the two-clock rule now applied consistently across pages: **functional**
  (clinical/business) KPIs — adoption, compliance, deviations, event volume, referrals,
  patient cohorts — are measured on clinical `event_time`, so ingestion lag never shifts
  the numbers; **technical/operational** metrics (the Ingestion page) are measured on
  processing `received_at`. Every page is clinical EXCEPT Ingestion. Compliance/Patients
  cohorts date-filter on `enrolled_at`, which the compliance-service now sets to clinical
  time (pre-existing rows remain processing-time until re-snapshot/replay).

### Materialized View Inventory

- **Added** `mv_daily_referral_kpis` (schema/07, event_time-keyed) backing the Referrals KPI.
- **Removed** `mv_daily_facility_kpis` and `mv_daily_facility_activity_summary`. The
  Facilities ranking is now computed live from the enrolled-patient cohort joined to
  `inbound_event_logs`, and the active-facility tiles read `mv_event_volume_hourly`
  (event_time-keyed). The daily-summary MVs read by this service are now
  `mv_daily_compliance_kpis`, `mv_daily_event_kpis`, `mv_daily_deviation_kpis`,
  `mv_daily_adoption_kpis`, and `mv_daily_referral_kpis`.

### Soft-Delete Phantom Row Fix

- **`_is_deleted = 0` filter** added to all 14 query methods in `ProtocolInstanceRepositoryImpl`. ClickHouse `ReplacingMergeTree(_version, _is_deleted)` tables receive Debezium CDC tombstone rows (`_is_deleted=1`) when a patient enrollment is deleted in Postgres. Without explicit filtering, these phantom rows appear in compliance counts, patient lists, and enrollment trends until background merges run. The fix is a `notDeleted()` helper that appends `_is_deleted = 0` as the first WHERE condition on every query against `protocol_instances`, independently of whether the `FINAL` clause is enabled.

### Patient Compliance — Date Filter Mode

- **`dateFilterMode` query parameter** added to `GET /v1/insights/protocols/{protocolDefinitionId}/patients`. Accepts `enrollment` (default) or `activity`.
  - `enrollment` (unchanged behaviour) — cohort = patients whose `enrolled_at` falls within `[startDate, endDate]`.
  - `activity` — cohort = patients with at least one step instance whose `updated_at` falls within `[startDate, endDate]`, regardless of enrollment date. Powered by a new `findByProtocolDefinitionIdWithActivityBetween` repository method that uses an IN subquery on `step_instances.updated_at`.
- **Cache key** for `getProtocolPatients` updated to include `dateFilterMode` so toggling modes invalidates the cached page.
- **UI toggle** — Patient Compliance page (`PatientList.tsx`) shows radio buttons "Enrollment Date" / "Activity Date". The subtitle under the page header updates dynamically to describe which cohort is being shown.

### Protocol Journey Sub-Step Visibility Fix

- **Bug fixed:** on Patient Detail, a root step that was `NOT_STARTED` and filtered out could still have its sub-steps rendered. For example, "Lab Order" (root, `NOT_STARTED`, not yet triggered) was hidden but "Laboratory Results" (its sub-step) still appeared.
- **Root cause:** the inline `.filter()` only checked the sub-step's own status, not whether its parent root step was visible.
- **Fix:** `PatientDetail.tsx` Protocol Journey section now uses a two-pass algorithm — first pass pre-computes a `visibleRootIdx` set for all root steps; second pass filters each step using parent visibility inheritance so sub-steps of hidden roots are also hidden.

### jOOQ Regeneration

- Regenerated jOOQ sources from live ClickHouse schema (`./gradlew generateJooq`). Four columns removed from generated history tables (`ProtocolInstanceHistory`, `StepInstanceHistory`) matching schema changes made upstream — these columns are genuinely absent from the ClickHouse schema and no application code referenced them.

### Metric Definitions — Fundamental Fixes

A workspace-wide audit found 14 places where two screens computed the "same" KPI from
different sources, where a global filter was silently dropped, or where snapshot rows
were summed across days. The following changes align everything to a single set of
definitions; see `docs/data-dictionary.md` for the canonical formulas.

- **Active / Inactive Facilities** — counted from `inbound_event_logs` (status =
  `ACCEPTED`) intersected with the facility reference list, matching the requirement
  that *any successful HIE submission qualifies*. Previously sourced from
  `mv_daily_facility_kpis.event_count`, which excluded accepted-but-unmatched events.
- **Facility Ranking `totalEvents`** — now sourced from `inbound_event_logs` for the
  same reason; the "Events (period)" column aligns with the Events → By Facility table
  and the Active Facilities tile.
- **Deviation header KPIs** — counted from the `deviations` base table by
  `detected_at`, not by summing `mv_daily_deviation_kpis` snapshot rows (which
  inflated totals by counting still-open deviations every day they appeared).
- **e-Buzima Adoption period columns** — `actualVisitsPerDay` and `reportingGapPerDay`
  are now daily averages over the calendar range (matching the column labels), not
  period totals.
- **Dashboard vs Compliance Overview Tracked Patients** — both surfaces now count
  *distinct patients enrolled in the selected period* (Compliance Overview previously
  reported active-as-of-snapshot, which made the two pages disagree).

### Filter Wiring (previously silently dropped)

- **Global facility filter** — `facilityId` is now applied through
  `/dashboard/compliance-summary`, `/facilities/ranking`,
  `/protocols/{id}/patients`, `/deviations/kpis`, deviation `intelligence-summary`
  recent-activity windows, `/events/summary`, `/events/by-resource-type`,
  `/events/by-facility`, `/facilities/activity-summary` (single-facility tile),
  `/facilities/adoption`, `/protocols/{id}/outcome-distribution`,
  `/protocols/{id}/enrollment-trends`, and `/patients/repeat-deviations`.
- **Date range filter** — `/facilities/{facilityId}/compliance-summary`,
  `/protocols/{id}/step-analytics`, `/protocols/{id}/completion-funnel`,
  `/patients/{id}/compliance-timeline`, and `/patients/at-risk-hotspots` now respect
  `startDate` / `endDate` instead of always returning all-time numbers. Step
  analytics, completion funnel, and practitioner step-completion narrow to
  enrollments enrolled in the selected period; patient timeline filters timeline
  events by `timestamp` within the range (Protocol Journey remains a full step list
  by design).
- **Protocol filter** — `/intelligence/summary`, `/practitioners/ranking`,
  `/patients/at-risk-hotspots`, and `/patients/repeat-deviations` now accept
  `protocolDefinitionId`; protocol-analytics endpoints
  (`completion-funnel`, `outcome-distribution`) narrow to enrollments in the
  selected period.
- **Cache keys** — `dev-action`, `dev-resolution`, `step-analytics`, `funnel`,
  `outcome`, `practitioner-rankings`, `compliance-all`, `compliance-{protocol}`,
  `facility-{id}`, `dev-trends`, `enrollment`, `risk-hotspots`, `repeat-deviations`,
  and `facility-activity-single` cache keys all include date range / facility /
  protocol where applicable so changing filters no longer returns stale results.
- **Event Volume header KPIs** — Total Events, Matched Rate, Zero Match Rate, and
  Duplicates now come from `/events/summary` (date-range aware) instead of the
  cumulative `/events/kpis` MV. Pipeline Loss intentionally remains cumulative as a
  pipeline-health indicator and is labelled accordingly in the UI.

### Naming

- `PatientList` description, Practitioner Analytics tiles, and ranking column relabeled
  to **"Step Completion"** to make explicit that the metric differs from the
  deviation-based patient compliance shown on the Dashboard.
- `e-Buzima Adoption` columns renamed to **Expected Visits / Day**, **Actual Visits /
  Day**, **Reporting Gap / Day**, **Adoption Rate** (column order also swapped).

### UI changes

- **Patient Detail → Deviations** card: removed the `skipDateFilter` bypass so it now
  follows the global date range like every other surface.
- **Event Volume → By Facility** table: facility ids replaced with names (resolved
  via `/lookups/facilities`); facilities with zero events are still listed (sorted by
  Total Events desc); pagination switched to the standard "1-N of M" range control.

### API Field Renames (breaking)

- `AdoptionKpi.expectedPatientsPerDay` → `expectedVisitsPerDay`
- `AdoptionKpi.actualPatients` → `actualVisitsPerDay`
- `AdoptionKpi.reportingGap` → `reportingGapPerDay`
- `FacilityReference.expectedPatientsPerDay` → `expectedVisitsPerDay`

UI and service must be deployed together.

### Removed

- **`GET /v1/insights/events/source-comparison`** — Removed source comparison endpoint, `SourceComparisonDto`, overlap/unique repository queries, and related integration tests.
- **`GET /v1/insights/events/by-practitioner`**, **`GET /v1/insights/events/by-source`**, **`GET /v1/insights/events/processing-quality`** — Removed practitioner/source/processing-quality event endpoints, services, DTOs, repository queries, and tests.

- **Fix scripts** — `04-fix-demo-data.sql` provides migration script for applying corrections to live databases

---

### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed:** Step analytics (Service Workflow Compliance) showed inflated percentages (e.g., 1000%) when facility filter was active — step counts were unfiltered while denominator was facility-filtered
- **Fixed:** `AT_RISK` compliance category removed — only `COMPLIANT`, `MODERATE`, `NON_COMPLIANT` remain
- **Fixed:** Intelligence summary counted only last 30 days — now counts all deviations
- **Fixed:** Facility filter ignored on protocol compliance summary endpoints
- **Fixed:** Compliance rate formula now uses step-based calculation

### Bug Fixes in This Release

- **Fixed:** `FacilityRankingService.deviationCountMap` was never populated — compliance rate always returned 100%. Now queries deviation counts per facility.
- **Fixed:** `FacilityRankingService` compliance rate formula — changed from `1 - deviations/events` to step-based `(completedSteps + skippedSteps) / totalSteps`. Uses `findStepComplianceByFacility()` query.
- **Fixed:** `FacilityRankingService` rankBy switch-case — now matches UI values (`complianceRate`, `deviationCount`, `eventVolume`). Added `order` parameter (asc/desc) support.
- **Fixed:** `PatientRiskService.getAtRiskHotspots()` — was computing compliance categories globally instead of per-facility. Added `findFacilityPatientMapping()` query to scope patients per facility.
- **Fixed:** `ComplianceSummaryService.getFacilityComplianceSummary()` — was ignoring `facilityId` filter. Added `findPatientsByFacility()` query to restrict results to the requested facility.
- **Fixed:** `EventVolumeService.getTrends()` — source parameter was not being passed from controller to service. Wired the parameter through.
- **Fixed:** `EventVolumeService.getSummary()` — `processingStatusBreakdown` was always `null`. Now populates with `{matched: {count, percentage}, zeroMatch: {count, percentage}, duplicate: {count, percentage}}` using `countByProcessingStatus()` query.
- **Fixed:** Missing `logstash-logback-encoder` dependency — JSON logging (docker profile) would fail at runtime.
- **Fixed:** PostgreSQL nullable parameter CAST issue — native queries with nullable parameters now use `CAST(:param AS type)` across all 4 repository files.
- **Fixed:** `EventVolumeService.getSummary()` indexing bug — `countByFacility()` returns 3 columns but code indexed wrong column as count.
- **Fixed:** `java.time.Instant` casting — PostgreSQL returns `Instant` for `timestamptz` columns in native queries, not `Timestamp`. Added `DateUtil.toOffsetDateTime()` utility.
- **Fixed:** CSV export `HttpMessageNotWritableException` — `StreamingResponseBody` in `ResponseEntity` fails content negotiation. Rewritten to use `HttpServletResponse` directly.
- **Fixed:** `GlobalExceptionHandler` was silently swallowing exceptions — added `@Slf4j` and `log.error()` calls.

### Code Quality Improvements

- Extracted `DateUtil` utility — eliminated 4x duplicated `mapInterval()` and `extractDate()` methods across services.
- Added `DateUtil.toOffsetDateTime()` helper — handles `Instant`, `OffsetDateTime`, and `Timestamp` type conversion from native query results.
- Added `.dockerignore` for optimized Docker builds.
- Added `.env.example` for environment variable documentation.
- Implemented Caffeine caching with `@Cacheable` annotations on 25 service methods across 9 classes.

---

### Known Limitations

- **PatientController** accesses repositories directly — business logic should be delegated to services in a future refactor.
- **No pagination** on some list endpoints — cursor pagination to be added where missing.
- **Per-instance caching** — Caffeine caches are not shared across instances. Phase 2 will introduce Redis for distributed caching.
