# CCE Insights Service — AI Agent Instructions

## Architecture

Spring Boot 3.4.x / Java 21 microservice that serves compliance analytics — protocol adherence rates, deviation trends, facility-level summaries, patient compliance timelines, ingestion pipeline metrics, and source system quality analysis. It is a **read-only** service that queries the Compliance DB and Collector DB directly (Phase 1). All requests arrive via the CCE Gateway Service, which handles authentication and authorization.

> **Naming:** This service is referred to as "Analytics Service" in the CCE Solution Design v0.3 document. It has been renamed to **Insights Service** (`cce-insights-service`) for the implementation.

**Core role:** Aggregate and serve compliance data for dashboards, reports, and data exports. No event processing, no protocol matching, no state transitions.

## Key Conventions

- **Package:** `org.openphc.cce.insights` — ~95 source files across 12 packages
- **Read-only database access:** No writes to any table. Uses Spring Data JPA with read-only transactions (`@Transactional(readOnly = true)`)
- **Shared database:** Connects to the same PostgreSQL database (`cce_collector`) as all other CCE services (Phase 1). Queries `protocol_instance`, `step_instance`, `deviation`, `protocol_definition`, `event_log`, `inbound_event` tables.
- **No Kafka integration:** Does not consume from or produce to any Kafka topic. Purely REST API → Database.
- **DTOs only:** Never exposes JPA entities in REST responses. Separate DTOs.
- **All timestamps:** `OffsetDateTime` in UTC
- **IDs:** `UUID` for all entity primary keys
- **Caching:** Caffeine in-memory caching with 3 tiers — `lookups` (60 min TTL), `analytics` (30 min TTL), `metrics` (15 min TTL). TTLs configurable via env vars.
- **Build tool:** Gradle 8.x
- **No Flyway migrations:** The Insights Service does not own any tables. Schema is managed by the Protocol, Matcher and Step SLA services (the 1.x Compliance Service, split in 2.0.0); the service reads their ClickHouse copies (`cce_analytics`, DDL in `cce-data-pipeline/schema`).

## Database Access (Read-Only)

### Tables Queried

| Table | Owner | Access | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `protocol_instance` | Matcher Service | Read-only | Patient enrollments, compliance rates (no `protocol_canonical` since 2.0.0 — join `protocol_definition`) |
| `step_instance` | Matcher (`step_status`) / Step SLA (`sla_status`) | Read-only | Step status pair, timing, completion |
| `step_sla_state_transition` | Matcher / Step SLA | Read-only | SLA thresholds (`process_by`) — deviation occurrence dates |
| `deviation` | Step SLA / Matcher | Read-only | Deviation records, trends (no `protocol_instance_id` since 2.0.0 — go through `step_instance`) |
| `protocol_definition` | Protocol Service | Read-only | Protocol metadata (name, version) |
| `matcher_event_log` (1.x `event_log`) | Matcher Service | Read-only | Patient event timeline, facility ID source |
| `inbound_event` | Collector Service | Read-only | Ingestion pipeline, source event counts |

### Key Aggregation Queries

- **Protocol compliance rate:** Count of `step_instance` by `step_status` (and `step_status` × `sla_status` for on-time / late) grouped by protocol
- **Facility summary:** JOIN `protocol_instance` → `event_log` (for `facility_id`) → `step_instance`
- **Step analytics:** COUNT by `step_status` and `sla_status` per `action_id`, with `medianIf` for median
- **Completion funnel:** COUNT DISTINCT `patient_id` reached vs completed per `action_id`
- **Outcome distribution:** COUNT `protocol_instance` grouped by `status`
- **Enrollment trends:** COUNT `protocol_instance` grouped by `DATE_TRUNC(:interval, enrolled_at)`
- **Facility ranking:** Cross-table aggregation of compliance rate, deviation count, event volume per `facility_id`
- **Deviation trends:** COUNT deviations grouped by `deviation_type`, `detected_at` (date-truncated)
- **Deviations by action:** COUNT deviations grouped by `step_instance.action_id`
- **Resolution rate:** Track `OVERDUE` deviations → `step_instance` (`step_status` COMPLETED = resolved, NOT_STARTED + `sla_status` MISSED = escalated)
- **At-risk hotspots:** Classify patients per facility as on_track/at_risk/non_compliant from their outstanding steps' `sla_status` (OVERDUE = at risk, MISSED = non-compliant)
- **Repeat deviations:** COUNT deviations per `patient_id` with `HAVING COUNT(*) >= :minDeviations`
- **Patient timeline:** JOIN `event_log` + `step_instance` ordered by `event_time`
- **Ingestion funnel:** COUNT `inbound_event` grouped by `status` (ACCEPTED/REJECTED/DUPLICATE)
- **Rejection breakdown:** COUNT `inbound_event` WHERE `status = 'REJECTED'` grouped by `rejection_reason`, `source`
- **Source data quality:** Per-source acceptance/rejection/duplicate rates from `inbound_event`
- **Pipeline loss:** Compare accepted `inbound_event` count vs matched `event_log` count
- **Paginated deviations list:** All deviations with date range filter, full pagination support

## Key Source Files

| File | Purpose |

| `LookupController.java` | Filter dropdown endpoints — protocols, facilities, practitioners, sources, patients |
| `IngestionAnalyticsController.java` | Ingestion pipeline analytics — funnel, rejections, quality, loss |
| `DateUtil.java` | Shared utility — `mapInterval()`, `extractDate()`, `toOffsetDateTime()` (Instant/Timestamp handling) |

| `GlobalExceptionHandler.java` | Central exception handling with structured error responses and logging |
| `ReadOnlyRepository.java` | Base repository — removes all write methods for safety |

## What's NOT in Scope (Release 1.0.0)

- **Dedicated analytics database** (Phase 2) — initial release queries Compliance DB directly
- **Redis caching** — uses Caffeine in-memory caching; Redis for distributed caching in Phase 2
- **Real-time streaming analytics** — no Kafka consumption; batch queries only
- **Data export scheduling** — exports are on-demand via API only
- **Intelligence event aggregation** — intelligence triggers are not yet published by Compliance Service in 1.0.0
